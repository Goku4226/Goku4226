-  Hi, I’m @Goku4226.
-  I’m interested in Developing skills to better myself and get a decent job.
-  I’m currently learning Python, Git/Github, Java, Powershell, SQL, .net and potentially get my CCNA.
-  You can reach me via email or discord.
-  I have no idea what I'm doing but one step at a time should help!
- I really hope I can retain all of this!
